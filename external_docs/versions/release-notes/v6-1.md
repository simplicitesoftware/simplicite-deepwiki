Version 6.1 release note
========================

:::danger
**Warning**: This legacy minor version of major version 6 is **not maintained anymore**.

Make sure you upgrade to the current minor version of major version 6.
:::

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

- All deprecated methods from V3 and V4 have been removed
	- the legacy methods were already marked as deprecated in the logs a long time ago,
	- and had to be modified in V5.

- The deprecated `PlatformHooks.isMenuEnable` has been removed.
  See [minor version 6.0 release note](v6-0#core-changes) for refactoring instructions.

- No more internal EJB support to access the database:
	- Nothing to do when Simplicité is deployed on Tomcat,
	- This feature is no more used since Simplicité V3 (transaction support with XA services),
	- The webapp connects the database thru a monitored connections pool (JDBC),
	- APIs use internal cache to guarantee high performance while optimizing memory.

- Removed wrapper for Rhino hooks implementation:
	- Rhino has been removed for hook implementation since V6.0
	- Classes `ScriptedObjectDB`, `ScriptedProcessus`, `ScriptedDisposition`, `ScriptedExternalObject` and `ScriptedPlatformHooks` has been removed from platform
	- if necessary to be easily replaced by their primary class: `ObjectDB`, `Processus`, `Disposition`, `ExternalObject` and `PlatformHooks`

- The 3rd party **Unirest** lib v3 has been upgraded to v4 (core) which means you will have to modify
  all potential import statements in your java code from `kong.unirest.*` to `kong.unirest.core.*`.

- The 3rd party **PDFBox** lib v2 has been upgraded to v3 which means you will have to refactor
  any potential direct use of this library.

We also remind you that there have been some other compatibility breaking changes in the previous minor version:

- See [the release note of minor version 6.0](v6-0#compatibility-breaking-changes)

Deprecated features
-------------------

These are to be removed in the next minor version 6.2:

- Deprecated `Bootstrap V4` rendering: please check if the UI runs already with `BOOTSTRAP_VERSION=5`
- Deprecated `Fullcalendar V3`: it is strongly recommended to use `FULLCALENDAR_VERSION=5`
- Deprecated `Cordova` hybrid app for mobile device is no more supported, engine only uses the responsive UI directly in a browser and the WebPush feature

We also remind you that there have been some other compatibility deprecations in the previous minor version:

- See [the release note of minor version 6.0](v6-0#compatibility-breaking-changes)

Core changes
------------

- A single permission supports multiple profiles/groups to factorize rights rules

- Added a new platform hook `customErrorResponse` to override, if needed, some case of error responses.
  Typical usage would be for external objects to generate custom error pages/data for authentication errors.

- Added various JSON schemas for validation of JSON/YAML settings, etc.

- Added `AuditTool.checkDeadLinks` to detect dead links in logs and generate a SQL patch thru audit tool:

![](img/v6-1/dlaudit.png)
![](img/v6-1/dlpatch.png)

## UI changes {#uichanges}

- Added support for declaring a custom monospace font on a theme.
  Note that theme-level fonts are now using dedicated CSS variables instead of a generated `font-family` styles:
	- `--simplicite-font` for the main font
	- `--simplicite-font-mono` for the monospace font

- Added new **experimental** custom HTML tags to ease usage of standard UI components within custom pages/widgets:

- New state-model navbar
	- The related list of values can have a rendering
	- Each status needs to specify its role: milestone, optional, exception or hidden
	- 3 styles exist (pure CSS):
		- breadcrumb / arrows / metro-line
		- with 3 options: step counter / visited date / user login
	- Visited steps are based on the history table
	- Current step, optional and exception roles can have their own style
	- Non visited milestones (from list of values) are displayed after the visited ones

Examples based on the demo:

![](img/v6-1/lov.png)

breadcrumb with links

![](img/v6-1/nav1.png)

![](img/v6-1/nav2.png)

breadcrumb with arrows

![](img/v6-1/nav_arrow.png)

metro line style

![](img/v6-1/nav_metro.png)

metro line with 3 options: counter + user + date

![](img/v6-1/nav_metro2.png)

- The `states-navbar` can be displayed anywhere on form with the template editor to edit options

![](img/v6-1/naved1.png)

![](img/v6-1/naved2.png)

- New dialog options:
	- `fullscreen`: to show the dialog in 100% of the container
	- `scrollable`: true by default to scroll the dialog body (false to scroll the page)

- `Field updatable` property is now a enum-multi to support the new option editable `by list cell`:

![](img/v6-1/fld_upd.png)

Result:

![](img/v6-1/list_upd.png)

- List template to display rows without common table/tr/td
	- Define a HTML template with mapped fields and actions
	- Applies to dedicated context (main list, panel, datamap or ref picker)
	- Associate the template to the `List template` of business object

![](img/v6-1/list_tpl.png)

![](img/v6-1/list_row.png)

Result:

![](img/v6-1/list_rows.png)

- New hook `isFieldUpdatableByListCell`
	- to specify when a field is editable by cell
	- by default the method checks if the field is updatable as follow:

```java
/**
 * Checks if the field is updatable by list cell
 * @param f object field
 * @return true if the field can be changed in a list cell
 */
public boolean isFieldUpdatableByListCell(ObjectField f) {
	return f!=null
		&& f.isUpdatableByListCell() // Defined as updatable by cell ?
		&& !isReadOnly() // not a read only mode ?
		&& !isReadOnlyFields() // not a final status with read-only fields ?
		&& !getName().endsWith(Globals.HIST_SUFFIX); // not a history object
}
```

- New hook `isFieldUpdatableByListCell` example
  - the hook allows to limit some instances or user's profiles:

```java
public boolean isFieldUpdatableByListCell(ObjectField f) {
	return super.isFieldUpdatableByListCell(f)
		&& isPanelInstance()
		&& getGrant().hasResponsibility("APP_MANAGER");
}
```

- Allows update on simple referenced fields (not userkey) thru the parent list or form
	- Set referenced field to be updatable in the object field definition
	- Saving parent will also save updated referenced objects

Example: set the Stock of Product updatable thru the Order (by form, edit list and/or cell)

![](img/v6-1/updref.png)

The Stock will be updatable directly from one Order of the Product (within the form/list/cell):

![](img/v6-1/updref2.png)

- Instance name of view's item has been updated to isolate concurrent access on same object within several sub-views

```
<home|panel>_ajax_<objectName>_<viewName>_<itemPosition>
ex: home_ajax_DemoOrder_DemoHome_2
```
