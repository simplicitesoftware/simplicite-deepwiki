Version 5.1.x release note
==========================

:::danger[Warning]

This legacy minor version of major version 5 is **not maintained anymore**.

Make sure you upgrade to the current minor version of major version 5 (especially if you plan to upgrade to major version 6).

:::

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

### Log4j

Due to dependencies requirements the **Log4j** component has been upgraded from version 1 to version 2.

This change has nearly no impact on default logs produced by the platform
and does not change anything on its application logger class (`AppLog`).

But if you have customized your `log4j.xml` configuration (for version 1) file
you **must** migrate these customization to the `log4j2.xml` (for version 2) which uses a different XML syntax.

> **Note**: Log4J 2 has suffered from some critical vulnerabilities. Patched Log4J libs have been (and will always be)
> upgraded **as soon as** they have been released by the Apache Software Foundation. See bellow.

### Bootstrap

**Bootstrap v4** has been added since major Simplicité version 5.0 to **replace** Bootstrap v3 which was used in previous major Simplicité version 4.0.

This minor Simplicité version 5.1 still have the 2 versions of Bootstrap but the **v3** will not be supported anymore.

Bootstrap v3 will definitely be removed in next minor Simplicité version 5.2.

### Unit tests

The `unitTests` method signatures for shared code and platform hooks have been aligned,
if you have implemented such methods you must refactor them.

Core changes
------------

- Upgraded third party libs

- Precision min/max on number field (integer, float and big decimal) is checked during validation
- `Grant.getDBToday()` to get the current DB date syntax (without time: `today` on hsql, `curdate()` on mysql, `current_date` on postgresql...)

- Added `if="null"` keyword on XML fields
- It is now possible to pass a dedicated I/O and Git password for the privileged user (`designer`)
