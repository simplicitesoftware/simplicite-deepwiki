# Translations

## What is a Translation ?

Simplicité is a multi-language application. The Translations object is used to configure the different labels per language displayed in the application.

## Translations Configuration

Most of the configuration objects that are displayed in the application have multiple Translations linked to it e.g. Objects, Object Fields, Domains, Actions, Links, View, Searches, etc.

Depending on the object, the Translations have different configuration fields.

### Object

| ----- | ----------- |
| Language | User language |
| Translation | The object's label (singular) - used in forms |
| Plural | The object's label (plural) - used in lists |
| User help | The object's help text - displayed in under the help icon in the list's or form's header |

### Field / Object Field

| Language | The language of the translation. |
| Translation | The field's label |
| Plural | *unused for fields* |
| Simple help | Content added to a help button next to the field on the object's form |
| Short label on lists | Overrides the label for the field in lists |
| Placeholder | The field's placeholder - used in forms |

Link translations are used to override an object's translation when displayed in a linked list context.

## Using the Java API

You can use the `setLabel` method of the Java API to set the translations for an Object, Link, Field, Action, etc.

Example : Customizing an object's label for a specific user group

```simplicite-java
public void postLoad() {
	if (getGrant().hasResponsibility("USER_GROUP"))
		setLabel("My Custom Object Label");
}
```
