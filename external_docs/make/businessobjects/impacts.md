# Impacts

**Impacts** define the effect or result produced by a [Constraint](/make/businessobjects/constraints) when its execution conditions are met. They are used to dynamically alter the behavior, properties, or visibility of a business object and its attributes, without writing custom code.

Impacts are executed in the order they are configured and can override each other if multiple impacts target the same property.



## Types of Impacts

Impacts can be applied to different levels of a business object:

### 1. **Object-level Impacts**
These affect the entire object and control high-level operations:  
Choose **Apply to : Object property**
- **Action** - Allow or prevent the execution of object actions
- **Copy** – Allow or prevent record duplication
- **Export** – Allow or prevent record export
- **Update all** – Allow or prevent bulk updates
- **Paginated** – Allow or prevent pagination in lists
- **Preset search** – Allow or prevent the use of preset searches
- **Use data form** – Allow or prevent form display.
- **Create** – Allow or prevent record creation.
- **Update** – Allow or prevent record modification.
- **Delete** – Allow or prevent record deletion.



### 2. **Attribute-level Impacts**
These target specific fields (attributes) of the business object:  
Choose **Apply to : Field property**
- **Update** – Allow or prevent a field from being updated
- **Copy** – Allow or prevent a field from being copied
- **Visible** – Show or hide a field on the form
- **Search** – Show or hide the object search
- **Mandatory** – Require a value for the field
- **Filter value** – Apply a filter to the field values
- **Default value** – Automatically populate a field with a computed or predefined value
- **Field value** – Initialize the value of the field
- **List of values** – Define or override the list of selectable values



### 3. **UI Element Visibility Impacts**
These manage the display of related UI components:  
Choose **Apply to : Target visibility**
- **Action** – Show or hide form actions
- **Field area** – Show or hide field areas within a form
- **Link** – Show or hide relationships
- **Object panel** – Toggle visibility of panels or views tied to the object.


## How Impacts Work

When a Constraint's condition evaluates to **true**, its impacts are executed in the order configured.  
The **value of the impacted property** is determined by evaluating the "Expression" field linked to the impact:
- For boolean properties (e.g., **visible**, **copy**, **mandatory**), the expression must return `true` or `false`.
- For value properties (e.g., **default value**,**value**), the expression should return the actual value to assign.



## Order of Execution

The execution order is **critical**:
- Impacts run sequentially based on their defined order.
- A later impact can overwrite the result of an earlier one if both target the same property.

> **Example**:  
> If one impact hides a field and another later impact makes it visible, the last impact will override the previous one.



## Back-end vs Front-end Impacts

Impacts inherit their execution behavior from the parent constraint:
- **Front-end impacts** are executed in the browser (dynamic UI effects like field visibility).
- **Back-end impacts** are executed on the server (secure enforcement during save/validation).
- **Combined front and back impacts** offer both dynamic UI changes and server-side enforcement.



## Best Practices

- Use **front-end impacts** for improving the user experience (e.g., dynamically showing/hiding fields).
- Always pair **critical business rules** with **back-end impacts** to ensure security and consistency.
- Keep impact order organized to avoid unexpected overrides.
