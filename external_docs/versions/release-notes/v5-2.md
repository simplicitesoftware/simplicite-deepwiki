Version 5.2.x release note
==========================

:::danger
**Warning**: This legacy minor version of major version 5 is **not maintained anymore**.

Make sure you upgrade to the current minor version of major version 5 (especially if you plan to upgrade to major version 6).
:::

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

### Module packaging

Legacy XML-based module packaging (as plain XML or as XML in ZIP format) is not changed.

The previous version's experimental JSON module packaging (as plain JSON or "exploded" JSON in ZIP format) has been completely refactored.
The "exploded" JSON files layout has been changed accordingly:

- Previous JSON packages (exploded or not) are not importable with this new version
- All modules in a JSON format **must** be re-exported (or commited/pushed) first to respect the new formats before any import (or pulling).
- Older experimental versions are not comparable with the new JSON format

### Bootstrap and icons

- As announced in previous release **Bootstrap V3** tools have been definitely removed.
- To support a good UI resizing at any scale, all static **PNG** icons and images has been removed, they have been replaced by **SVG** images.
  You must replace any static URI to image with the `.svg` extension from your specific UI (nothing to do in case of API usage `$ui.view.icon(name)`).
- Moreover, the static `black`, `grey` and `purple` PNG images have been removed, they must be replaced by their equivalent fontawesome icons in your objects.

### HTTP Apache libs

- The legacy (and vulnerable) Apache commons' HTTP client lib version **3.1** has been removed.
  If your custom code uses it you must migrate to the current Apache HTTP Components' HTTP client lib version **4.x.y**

### JQPlot

- The location of the **jQPlot** libs has changed from the `scripts/jquery/jqplot` to `scripts/jqplot`
  if you have any hardcoded paths to these jQPlot libs you must change them accordingly

### JWT tokens

- The internal authentication provider is now using JWT tokens **by default** for both UI and API endpoints
  (this mode already existed in version 5.1 but was not the default).
- You can still switch back to the legacy dummy tokens by setting the `USERTOKEN_MODE` to `simple`.
- If you decide to use JWT tokens, all previously created dummy tokens must be deleted and don't forget to set
  a custom signature secret in the `USERTOKEN_SIGNATURE_SECRET` system parameter (note that changing this secret also
  causes all previously created tokens to become invalid).

### Required token credentials on API endpoint / public API

- **All** the API services exposed on the API endpoint `/api` now requires a token as credentials (passed either as an HTTP header `Authorization: Brearer <token>` or as a URL parameter).
- Username + password credentials are **only** accepted by the API **login service** (`api/login`) to deliver the above token. They are now **ignored** by all the other API services
- Calls done to the API services **without** a token is considered as done by the `public` user

> **Note**: if for some reason you have been using the `/` public UI endpoint for exposing some kind of "public API services", it **must** be refactored.
> This public UI endpoint has never been designed for API usage, it is an **UI** endpoint not suitable for providing API services:
> it is associated to a Tomcat session the must be maintained using a cookie, it has no scalability mecanisms, etc. using it was an anti-pattern.
> Prior to this minor version, the right pattern was to use a "technical" user on the API endpoint, now you can avoid this "technical" user.

### Deprecated "for removal" disposition hooks

The `displayHome` and `displayPublicHome` disposition hooks, which have been deprecated since version 4.0 (because they were used only by the legacy 3.x UI),
have been marked as deprecated "for removal" and will be definitly removed in next minor version.

If for any reason you are making anycustom use of these hooks you **must** refactor this. No standard use of these hookes is done since version 4.0.

### FullCalendar defaults to version 4

You can still remain on version 3 by setting the `FULLCALENDAR_VERSION` overridden value to `3` but you should consider migrating your custom code
using FullCalendar v3 to v4 or even v5 (which is still experimental in this minor release but will become the default version in next minor version 5.3).

See [this upgrading document](https://fullcalendar.io/upgrading-from-v3) for details on upgrading from FullCalendar v3.

### Foreign-keys completeness

The foreign-keys of object have to retrieve all the foreign user-key fields:
- Required for security reason when checking ID and user-keys consistency/unicity
- Required to re-import objects with the full referenced keys to find the corresponding local ID
- Required within API for the same reasons
- A warning is displayed on the object definition with the missing fields

All warnings have to be fixed by designers (right place in object, hidden or not...).

		"url": "https://my.custom.url",
		"javaVersion": "17",
		"dependencies": [
			{
				"groupId": "group1",
				"artifactId": "artifact1",
				"version": "1"
			},
			{
				"groupId": "group2",
				"artifactId": "artifact2",
				"version": "2"
			}
		]
	},
	"sonar": {
		"projectKey": "MyProjectKey",
		"projectName": "MyProjectName",
		"projectVersion": "V5",
		"organization":"MyOrg",
		"host.url": "https://my.sonar.url"
	},
	(...)
}
```

	- `stopOnError` option: stop or continue processing when an error is detected
	- use only the SAX parser: DOM parsing has been removed to free memory
	- import module is 2 times faster on average
	- allows to solve cyclic relationships / cross-referenced objects in only one scan

- New module type to separate core `System` and `Add-on` with business modules (application, toolbox, data...)

![](img/v5-2/mdl_type.png)

- Added "font" type for resources
- Optim cron job: create the asynchronous Thread only at startup to limit the JVM usage

- Added method to ObjectDB:
	- `ObjectDB.addResource`: to add a front resource to object dynamically
	- `ObjectDB.setCxtHelp(context, help)`: to change easily one context help

```java
@Override
public void postLoad() {
	String ts = String.valueOf(new Date().getTime());
	addResource("SCRIPT",
		new Resource("", "SCRIPT", Resource.TYPE_JAVASCRIPT,
			"(function() { ... })()".getBytes(),
			false, ts));
	addResource("STYLES",
		new Resource("", "STYLES", Resource.TYPE_CSS,
			".myclass { color: red; } ...".getBytes(),
			false, ts));
}
@Override
public void initList(ObjectDB parent) {
	super.initList(parent);
	if (parent!=null)
		setCtxHelp(ObjectCtxHelp.CTXHELP_PANELLIST, "My panel help...");
}
```

- Added development information for IDE tools
- Added Luhn algorithm check helper method in `Tool`
- Added `obo_role` on object definition to identify business objects, configuration objects or system
- Added MFA (second authentication factor) feature including 3 out of the box methods :
    - OTP sent by email
    - OTP sent by SMS
    - Time-based OTP (TOTP) from authenticator apps
  plus a custom mode implementable using the `initMFA` and `checkMFA` platform hooks

![](img/v5-2/mfa-config.png)

for TOTP the QRCode to configure authenticator apps is displayed at first login but it can also be re-displayed on the user's form:

![](img/v5-2/mfa-qrcode.png)

- New ability to rename table/column when installing a module with altered object's or field's name
	- `ObjectInternal` and `Field` have a new local history to trace naming changes
	- Export module: explains all old values in XML/JSON flows from local history
	- Import module: searches a definition with one of the older names to rename the table or column
	- When all DB are aligned (dev, test, prod...), histories can be removed to simplify module export
	- No more manual migration needed thru SQL

XML syntax example:

```xml
<data>
	<obo_name oldvalue="DemoSupplier2" oldvalue1="DemoSupplier">DemoSupplier3</obo_name>
	<obo_dbtable>demo_supplier3</obo_dbtable>
	...
</data>
...
<data>
	<fld_name oldvalue="demoSupWebsite2" oldvalue1="demoSupWebsite">demoSupWebsite3</fld_name>
	<fld_dbname>sup_website3</fld_dbname>
	...
</data>
```

JSON syntax example:

```json
"item": {
	"obo_name": {
		"value": "DemoSupplier3",
		"oldvalue": "DemoSupplier2",
		"oldvalue1": "DemoSupplier"
	},
	"obo_dbtable": "demo_supplier3",
	...
}
...
"item": {
	"fld_name": {
		"value": "demoSupWebsite3",
		"oldvalue": "demoSupWebsite2",
		"oldvalue1": "demoSupWebsite"
	},
	"fld_dbname": "sup_website3",
   ...
}
```

- Multiple `PlatformHooks*` for a best business isolation:
	- to allow different app/modules to have there own hooks implementation (`isMenuEnable`, `postSearchIndex`...)
	- the name of shared code must start with `PlatformHooks`
- Added a compile all action
- Added a new `customAlert` business object hook and media type for custom notification implementation for BPM alerts
- Force change password flag is now checked for I/O access, preventing using default `designer`'s password
- Added import modules at startup feature based on an import specification file (containing a JSON array of modules names and versions),
  example of a typical usage in Docker:

`Dockerfile` for building a custom image with the modules in it:

```text
FROM registry.simplicite.io/platform:<tag>
COPY modules webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/modules
```

With the following content for the `modules` folder:

```text
modules
|_ Demo-importspec.json
|_ Demo-5.zip
|_ DemoAPIs-5.zip
```

And the following content for the `Demo-importspec.json` file):


```json
{
  "title": "Demo",
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "Demo",
      "version": "5",
      "datasets": true
    },
    {
      "name": "DemoAPIs",
      "version": "5"
    }
  ]
}
```

This file can be generated from the top level module.

Note: At first startup the modules are imported, on subsequent startups a check is done on version number to prevent reimporting already imported modules.
This means this mechanism requires a proper modules' version management.

- User's grant parameter `USE_SOCIAL` depends only on responsibility `SOCIAL_USER` or `SOCIAL_ADMIN`.
  The system parameter `USE_SOCIAL` is deprecated and will be remove in release 5.3.
- Using an older webapp on an upgraded database is now causing a **FATAL** error that prevents platform
  to start up (this is to avoid unexpected side effects in this non supported case)
- Added `USE_API_TESTER` system parameter to enable/disable the API tester page
- Added `USE_HEALTH` system parameter to enable/disable the health check page/service
- Added `USE_MAVEN` system parameter to enable/disable the Maven repository exposed by the instance
- POST calls on health check page now returns JSON format by default (no change on GET calls)
- Added the `platform.godmode=true|false` JVM arg to globally enable/disable the god mode feature
  (which still requires to be individually granted using the `GOD_MODE_USER` system parameter)
- Refactored platform hooks methods `preAuth` and `postAuth` to allow returning an explicit error message
- Added number of Tomcat level active sessions in the health check
- Added enum multiple accessor `ObjectField.addValue` and `ObjectField.removeValue`
- Refactored services objects, especially the OpenDataSoft services objects that now supports version 2 of the underlying API
  and allows configuring an explicit list of fields (requires using version 2 of the API)
- Added an `init` hook on `ResponsiveExternalObject`
- Added tar.gz tools: `ZIPTool.tarGzip` and `ZIPTool.tarGzipExtract`
- Use tar.gz format to export module with exploded JSON files
- New adapter to import CSV with new lines support
	- `CSVAdapterCommon` based on Apache Common CSV
- Changed JGit SSH implementation from JSch to Apache Mina to support new SSH key formats

UI changes
----------

- Added title & addon resources for auth pages:
	- `LOGON_PROVIDERS_TITLE` and `LOGON_PROVIDERS_ADDON` for the auth providers selection page
	- `LOGON_TITLE` (and still the existing `LOGON_ADDON`) for the internal auth provider's logon page
- Added fetch on diagram container
- Improved print styles
- Status colors are now used in metrics dashboard
- The template editor now uses the syntax convention for the foreign key naming proposals
- User min rows / max rows are now optional

	- applies on main page, menu, panels, tabs, form and list
	- edit the addon styles for custom CSS

- Change event on View: `$ui.getUIView(ctn, obj, view).ui.change(function(e){...})`

- New Module panel to list all commits:
	- access the local GIT repository
	- with built-in list features: count, search and order by
	- with same actions: commit, push, pull and delete repository
	- and compare with previous/current commit

![](img/v5-2/moduleCommit.png)

- New module commit to GIT:
	- format choice: new JSON hierarchy or legacy XML
	- and choice to explode all configuration files in a Module tree
