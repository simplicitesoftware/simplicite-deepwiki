# Linked list

## What is a Linked list ?

Linked lists allow you to create dynamic dropdown menus where the available options in one field change based on what's selected in another field. 

For example:
- When you select "Country" in the first dropdown
- The second dropdown automatically updates to show only cities from that selected country

This creates a dependent or cascading relationship between two enumeration fields.

Key benefits:
- Helps users make valid selections
- Reduces errors by showing only relevant options
- Improves data integrity

### Example: Field Configuration

When configuring a Field, you'll notice this linked list behavior in action:

1. The Field object has two important properties:
   - A **Type** field
   - A **Rendering** configuration field

2. How it works:
   - When you change the value in the **Type** field
   - The available options in the **Rendering** field automatically update to show only relevant choices for that Type
