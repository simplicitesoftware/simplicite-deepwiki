Crontab
=======

Introduction
------------

The Simplicité crontab (internal task scheduler) allow you to schedule executions of **objects' actions** of method type.

> **Note**: You can choose which user will be processing the action, so you need to make sure this user is fully granted the involved business objects and actions

Cron expressions
----------------

### Introduction

The crontab uses standard **cron expressions**, which are able to create firing schedules
such as: _At 8:00am every Monday through Friday_ or _At 1:30am every last Friday of the month_.

### Format

A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain
any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field.
The fields are as follows:

| Field Name   | Mandatory? | Allowed Values       | Allowed Special Characters      |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Seconds      | YES        | `0-59`               | `,` `-` `*` `/`                 |
| Minutes      | YES        | `0-59`               | `,` `-` `*` `/`                 |
| Hours        | YES        | `0-23`               | `,` `-` `*` `/`                 |
| Day of month | YES        | `1-31`               | `,` `-` `*` `?` `/` `L` `W` `C` |
| Month        | YES        | `1-12` or `JAN-DEC`  | `,` `-` `*` `/`                 |
| Day of week  | YES        | `1-7` or `SUN-SAT`   | `,` `-` `*` `?` `/` `L` `C` `#` |
| Year         | NO         | empty, `1970-2099`   | `,` `-` `*` `/`                 |

So cron expressions can be as simple as this: `* * * * ? *` or more complex, like this: `0 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2010-2020`

### Special characters

- `*` _all values_: used to select all values within a field. For example, `*` in the minute field means _every minute_.
- `?` _no specific value_: useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character
  is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th),
  but don’t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put `10` in the day-of-month field, and `?` in the day-of-week field.
- `-` used to specify ranges. For example, `10-12` in the hour field means _the hours 10, 11 and 12_.
- `,` used to specify additional values. For example, `MON,WED,FRI` in the day-of-week field means _the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday_.
- `/` used to specify increments. For example, `0/15` in the seconds field means _the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45_. And `5/15` in the seconds
  field means _the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50_. You can also specify `/` after the `*` character - in this case `*` is equivalent to having `0` before the `/`.
  `1/3` in the day-of-month field means _every 3 days starting on the first day of the month_.
- `L` _last_: has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value `L` in the day-of-month field means _the last day of the month_
  (day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years). If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means `7` or `SAT`.
  But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means _the last xxx day of the month_ (for example `6L` means _the last friday of the month_.
  When using the `L` option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you will get confusing results.
- `W` _weekday_: used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify `15W` as
  the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: _the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month_. So if the 15th is a Saturday,
  the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday,
  then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify `1W` as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger
  will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not jump over the boundary of a month’s days. The `W` character can only be specified when the
  day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
- `#`: used to specify _the nth XXX day of the month_. For example, the value of `6#3` in the day-of-week field means _the third Friday of the month_
  (day `6` = Friday) and `#3` = _the 3rd one in the month_. Other examples: `2#1` = _the first Monday of the month_
  and `4#5` = _the fifth Wednesday of the month_. Note that if you specify `#5` and there is not `5` of the given day-of-week in the month,
  then no firing will occur that month.
- `C` _calendar_: this means values are calculated against the associated calendar, if any. If no calendar is associated, then it is equivalent to
  having an all-inclusive calendar. A value of `5C` in the day-of-month field means _the first day included by the calendar on or after the 5th_.
  A value of `1C` in the day-of-week field means _the first day included by the calendar on or after Sunday_.

> **Notes**:
> - The `L` and `W` characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield `LW`, which translates to _last weekday of the month_.
> - The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. `MON` is the same as `mon`.
