Link Mapping
============

What is a Link Mapping?
-----------------------

In **Simplicité**, a _Link Mapping_ is a standard mechanism used to **filter or restrict selectable values in a relationship (link)**
based on values already entered in a form.

It allows you to define _context-sensitive filters_ that dynamically limit choices in linked fields, improving user experience
and enforcing business logic consistency.

This is typically configured on object **links** (foreign key or many-to-one references), where the available values in the target
list must depend on another field value from the current object.

When should a Link Mapping be used?
-----------------------------------

Use a Link Mapping when:

- You want to **dynamically filter a foreign key** based on a field already filled in the form.
- You need to **restrict the values** shown in a reference dropdown to only those that make sense in a given context.
- You want to implement **contextual filtering** without custom coding.

**Example**: On a `Contact` form, once a `Customer` is selected, the `Order` dropdown should only display that customer's orders.
This is achieved through a link mapping between the `DemoContact.demoCtcCliId` and `DemoOrder.demoOrdCliId`.

How to configure a Link Mapping?
--------------------------------

1. Go to **Business objects > Link mapping** or select the desired link in the modeler or going to **Business objects > Links**.
2. If you are on a Link go to the **Link Mapping** tab.
3. Click **Create** and configure:
   - **Source field** – The field of the linked object used as filter.
   - **Mapped field** – The field on the referenced object that should match the source field.

4. Save the link mapping.
5. Test the filtering behavior by filling the source field in the form – the referenced dropdown will update accordingly.

### Example

In the Simplicité Demo:

- On the `Contact` object, the `Order` only displays orders **belonging to the selected customer**.
- The link mapping restricts `DemoOrder.demoOrdCliId` to match `DemoContact.demoCtcCliId`.

Custom Behavior with Hook
-------------------------

You can extend or override the default filtering logic using the hook:

```java
public void initRefSelect(ObjectDB parent) {
    // Custom filtering logic
}
