# Pivot table

## What is a Pivot table ?

Crosstabs allow you to cross-reference information object's fields of a given object. The tables are configured by choosing the following axes:
- the fields used as columns
- the fields used as rows
- the fields used as values

Only the object fields of the target business object can be used.

If there is no "value" axis, then the platform performs an enumeration.

Crosstabs offer many options to users:
- display or not the presented axes
- swapping of axes (`rows <-> columns`)
- filtering of the data used (note that the crosstab uses the filters already active on the object if a search has been performed)
- creation of graphs
- CSV, Excel, JSON exports (the latter can also be obtained by webservice)
