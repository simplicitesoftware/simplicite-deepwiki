# Guide Recorder

## What is Guide recorder?

In Simplicité [version 6.3](/versions/release-notes/v6-3), **Guide Recorder** is a helper tool to build a guide tour directly while navigating the UI.  

It allows guide creators to **capture each step of a guide**, define instructions, and configure actions interactively.  


## How to Access Guide Recorder

Access to **Guide Recorder** is restricted:  

- Users must have the `GUIDE_MAKER` responsibility.  
- Users must have read access to the **DomainSocialUser** domain.  

Without domain access, Guide Recorder will not be visible, even if the user has the `GUIDE_MAKER` responsibility.  

The menu can be found under **User Interaction > User Onboarding** in the application.

## Guide Recorder Usage

To create a guide using Guide Recorder:

1. **Navigate to the target screen** where you want to start the guide.  
2. **Activate Guide Recorder** from the menu.  
3. For each step in the guide:  
   - **Right-click** on the UI element you want to highlight.  
   - **Enter the step details** in the dialog that appears:   
     - **Step name** – The internal name of the step, used to identify it within the guide. Keep it short and descriptive (e.g., "Login Button").  
     - **Tooltip short title** – A brief title shown in the tooltip to summarize the step for the user. Usually one line (e.g., "Click to log in").  
     - **Tooltip long info** – Detailed instructions or explanations displayed in the tooltip. Provide context, guidance, or warnings (e.g., "Click this button to access your dashboard after entering your credentials.").  
     - **Selector** – The CSS or UI element selector that identifies the target element for the step. This is usually captured automatically but can be adjusted if needed.  
     - **Position** – The placement of the tooltip relative to the target element. Options: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`. Choose a position that is clearly visible.  
     - **Next event** – Defines what happens after the step is completed. Options include "Click", "Input Text", "Navigate to page", or "Wait for user interaction". Controls the flow to the next step.

4. **Repeat the process** for every step of the guide.  
5. **Save the guide** once all steps are captured.  

### Tips for Effective Guides

- Keep instructions **concise and clear**.  
- Highlight only **necessary elements** to avoid clutter.  
- Test the guide in **preview mode** to ensure steps execute correctly.  

## Managing Guides

After recording steps:

- **Edit Steps** – modify titles, descriptions, or actions if needed.  
- **Reorder Steps** – change the sequence of the guide if necessary.  
- **Preview the Guide** – simulate the guide as an end-user to verify clarity.  
- **Publish** – make the guide available to end-users.
