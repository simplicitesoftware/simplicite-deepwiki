# Permissions

## Introduction

Since version 6.0, Permissions have replaced Functions for several Objects of the metamodel.  

The Function Configuration Object is now dedicated to Business Objects, Actions and Views.  

A **Permission** is a Configuration Object in the metamodel that allows controlling access rights and visibility for various system objects. It provides more flexibility than Functions by allowing finer control over attributes such as visibility, update properties, and other constraints that can be overridden for specific Groups.  

## Features

1. **Permissions Control**
    - Permissions can be used to define access rights for a wide range of Configuration Objects.  
    - They provide control over the visibility and properties of objects, overriding default settings for specific Groups.  
    - Permissions can be applied to objects like Agenda, Domain, and Business Objects, among others.  

2. **Object Types**
    - Permissions can be created for both:
        - **Business objects**, **Fields**, and **ObjectFields** where properties can be overridden.  
        - **Other Configuration Objects** like Agenda, Search, Timesheet, and more.  

3. **Group-Based Permissions**
    - Permissions allow setting specific access rights for Groups, making them more scalable and maintainable for different user roles.  

## Configuration

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Target Object** | The target object for which the permission is set |
| **Visible** | Visible Property being overridden (e.g., visibility) |
| **Updatable** | Updatable overridden property |
| **Property** | Property overridden |
| **Primary Group** | Group to which the permission applies |
| **Group permissions** | Others Groups to which the permission applies |
| **Module** | The module to which the Permission belongs |
