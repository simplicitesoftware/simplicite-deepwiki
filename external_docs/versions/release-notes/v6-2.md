Version 6.2 release note
========================

:::danger[Warning]

This legacy minor version of major version 6 is now in its **short term maintenance** till Aril 15th 2026**.

Make sure you upgrade to the current minor version of major version 6.

:::

Technical documentation
-----------------------

All the technical documentation is available from the [platform website](https://platform.simplicite.io), in particular:

- the [JavaDoc](https://platform.simplicite.io/6.2/javadoc/)
- the [JSDoc](https://platform.simplicite.io/6.2/jsdoc/)

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

- Due to 3rd party components, the platform is now compiled using a **JDK 17**, it will **not** run on a JVM of version < 17

- **Bootstrap** v4 and **datetimepicker** v4 have been removed, the UI runs now exclusively with bootstrap5 engine
  (since Simplicité V5)
- **Fullcalendar** v3 has been removed, it is strongly recommended to use `FULLCALENDAR_VERSION=5`
- **Cordova** hybrid app for mobile device is no more supported, engine only uses the responsive UI directly
  in a browser and the WebPush feature
- A dependency of **commons-vfs2** including an indirect old **okhttp** lib has been upgraded removing this lib,
  there are no plans to include an up-to-date okhttp3 lib because unirest is a good alternative of this lib and is explicitly included
- A minimal length of 25 characters is now required for the I/O password denoted by the `io.password` JVM property
  or the `IO_PASSWORD` environment variable shorter password is now ignored (with an explicit warning at startup)

Included but not yet enabled by default:

- **Chart.js** v4, default charting (e.g. pivot tables' charts) still relies on v3

### Previous minor versions' compatibility breaking changes

Please note that there have also been compatibility breaking changes in previous minor versions:

- See [the release note of minor version 6.0](v6-0#compatibility-breaking-changes)
- See [the release note of minor version 6.1](v6-1#compatibility-breaking-changes)

Deprecations
------------

### Deprecated iText

The legacy iText Java lib usage has been deprecated, no default components relies on it any longer.
This lib will be removed in next major version v7.

- `PDFTool` methods have been deprecated. It is recommended to migrate to PDF generation
  using [HTMLToPDFTool](https://platform.simplicite.io/6.2/javadoc/com/simplicite/util/tools/HTMLToPDFTool.html)
  or [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/).
- If continued use of iText is necessary, it can still be integrated as an additional third-party library. However,
  it is strongly advised to purchase a license and use an up-to-date version due to
  [the licensing and security matters associated with iText 2.1.7](https://kb.itextpdf.com/it5kb/can-itext-2-1-7-itextsharp-4-1-6-or-earlier-be-use).
- The native PDF exports (lists and module documentation) have been migrated to PDFBox.

### Previous minor versions' deprecations

Please note that additional compatibility deprecations were introduced in previous minor versions:

- See [the release note of minor version 6.0](v6-0#compatibility-breaking-changes)
- See [the release note of minor version 6.1](v6-1#deprecations)

Core changes
------------

### New action to anonymize a user

- with options to sanitize the user (infos, rights, preferences and social interactions)
- extendable with a new PlatformHooks `anonymizeUser`

![](img/v6-2/anon.png)

```java
/**
 * Anonymize a user
 * @param login user login to sanitize
 * @param rights true to delete all user's responsibilities
 * @param prefs true to delete all user's preferences (user filters, searches, parameters)
 * @param social true to delete all interactions (social, alert, notif)
 * @param randomizedLogin optional value to randomize the login everywhere in DB (timestamps, sessions history, redolog...)
 */
@Override
public Message anonymizeUser(String login, boolean rights, boolean prefs, boolean social, String randomizedLogin) {
	// sanitize the user infos, rights, preferences and social interactions
	Message m = super.anonymizeUser(login, rights, prefs, social, randomizedLogin);
	if (m.isOk()) {
		// add custom anonymization here...
	} else {
		// denied
	}
	return m;
}
```

### JSON Backend messages

> no more formatted messages with hashtags "#"

- APIs `Message.formatXXX` will now return JSON messages
- JSONs are serialized to String to be compatible with returns of java hook (pre/postValidate, pre/postSave...)
- Legacy format with "#" is still supported but deprecated (i.e. `code:text#level#field`).
- It is strongly recommended to change/use one of the `Message.formatXXX` to format a message (on validate, save...)

```json
{
	code: "MY_ERROR_CODE", // static TEXT to be translated on UI
	text: "optional additional text in user language",
	field: "myField", // optional related field on UI
	level: "ERROR", // TEXT, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
	actions: [{ action definition }...], // optional list of call to actions
	params: { suggest: "Suggested value" } // optional suggestion of syntax
}
```

### New action to generate object

- a referenced object (0,1) or an aggregated object (0,n) from existing object fields
- designer selects some fields from the object-fields panel
- and sets the linked object name, prefix and table
- then choose the user-key for the new object
- the action generates 2 shared scripts: a patch XML and SQL to migrate the business model and the data
- when XML is applied, the designer must complete the generated object (user-key, rights, user menu...)
- the SQL script can be applied in several instances (dev, test, prod...)
  - populate the new table with distinct values from existing records
  - update the new foreign keys to/from the new table

1. Select fields and click on "Generate object"

   ![](img/v6-2/genobjn.png)

2. Set the link properties and confirm

   ![](img/v6-2/genobjconf.png)

3. Generate the patches

   Example after generating a reference table from distinct countries of customers:

   ![](img/v6-2/genobjconf2.png)
   ![](img/v6-2/genobjxml.png)
   ![](img/v6-2/genobjsql.png)

4. Apply them to get the object with migrated data

   Designer must finalize the configuration of the generated object.

  ![](img/v6-2/genobjres.png)

  ![](img/v6-2/genobjm.png)

### `customPingResponse` Platform hook

- Added a new `customPingResponse` platform hook to customize the `/ping` JSON response, e.g.:

```java
@Override
public JSONObject customPingResponse(String status, String error) {
	return new JSONObject()
		.put("myCustomStatus", "The status is: " + ("OK".equals(status) ? "All good" : "Houston we have a problem"))
		.put("myCustomError", Tool.isEmpty(error) ? null : "The error is: " + error);
}
```

### Other changes

- New shared script type to apply `XML patches`

- Cascade deletions will always call `pre/postDelete` hooks (no more parameter `DELETE_CHILD_HOOK=no`)

- Added automatic conversion to PDF for a text publication template file (e.g. HTML, plain text, ...)
  with forced MIME type set to PDF

- Added `minimal` value for `USE_HEALTH` system parameter to restrict healthcheck to monitoring-only data
  (no information on JVM, server, OS, ...)

- Changed ping and healthcheck to return a `503` instead of a `500` in case of database unavailability

- Added new tags for publication templates:

  - `[SYSPARAM:<parameter name>]` for substituting a system parameter
  - `[LABEL:<object name>:<-|+>]` for substituting singular (`-`) or plural (`+`) object label

- New instances of object during a `DataLink` synchronization:

  - Needs a dedicated user for datalink API to isolate those instances in objects pool
  - Allows distinct rules in hooks:
    - `isDataLinkInstance() && isBatchInstance()`: detect a pull from a host (cron job: bulk resync)
    - `isDataLinkInstance() && isWebServiceInstance()`: detect a push to hosts (REST/PUT: single record)

- New object accessor `forceGroupByFields` to change the group-by fields to search:

```java
boolean previousGroupBy = obj.canGroupByFields();
List<ObjectField> previousFields = obj.getGroupByFields();
try {
	obj.setGroupByFields(true);
	obj.forceGroupByFields(new String[] { "myField1", "myField2" });
	List<String[]> rows = obj.searchGroupBy(false, 1000);
	for (String[] row : rows) {
		// count per myField1,myField2 (last column)
		String count = row[row.length-1];
		// row with field operators (sum, avg...) per myField1,myField2
		obj.setValues(row);
		// ...
	}
}
finally {
	// restore
	obj.setGroupByFields(previousGroupBy);
	obj.setGroupByFields(previousFields);
}
```

- Added static method `Grant.getUserFullName(userId, orLogin)` to get any user's fullname

- Added the ability to configure an explicit "pepper" string for internal password "salting"
  using the `HASH_PASSWORD_PEPPER` environment variable or the `hash.password.pepper` JVM property.
  This is only taken into account if internal password hashing is enabled (system parameter `SALT_PASSWORD` = `yes`).
  The default "pepper" strategy is still used without this explicit "pepper" string. Note that adding
  or changing it requires **all users' passwords** to be changed.

- Added a new adapter base class `SimplePDFBoxAdapter` using the PDFBox library.
  It provides hooks to process the text content of the PDF,
  the PDF document information (title, ...), and the potential form fields entered in a fillable PDF

- `ExternalObject.display` can return an `InputStream` (from a file or anything huge) to be sent by packets in the HTTP response

- New filter "not in" on ENUM field to search unknown LOV values, displayed as "(other)" on UI.

- New `getRefFieldTargetObject` hook to override the target record of a referenced field :

```java
@Override
public String[] getRefFieldTargetObject(String rowId, ObjectField field, String[] row) {
	if (field.getFullInput().contains("myForeignKey")) {
		rowId = getFieldValue("myOtherFkValue"); // target id
		String t[] = new String[3];
		String target = "MyOtherObject";
		t[0] = target; // target object
		t[1] = "the_ajax_"+target; // main target instance
		t[2] = rowId; // target id
		return t;
	}
	return null;
}
```

UI changes
----------

### The `Call to action` of backend message is now implemented in the alert dialog

- a backend action can now return other call-to-actions
- actions to call must be granted to user
- with the type hidden to avoid direct access thru list or form

### New `hasChangedFields` to determine the global `hasChanged` flag on form

- The property `hasChanged` has been improved so that it only triggers if a field has actually been modified
  (different from the base value)
- For example, if the user changes a field twice and returns to its original value,
  the dialog "quit without saving" will no longer appear.

- It is now possible - and recommended - to implement a `ResponsiveExternalObject` JavaScript script
  as a **JavaScript class** extending `Simplicite.UI.ExternalObject`
  with an override of the `render` class function, e.g.:

```javascript
Simplicite.UI.ExternalObjects.MyExtObj = class extends (
  Simplicite.UI.ExternalObject
) {
  async render(params, data) {
    this.ctn.find(".mycls").html("Hello world!");
    // or $('#myid').html('Hello world!');
  }
};
```

### New UI tabs options for tabbed areas

- Tabs positioning on top/left/right/bottom
- Allows to hide all tab labels (to display only icons)
- Configurable on template editor

![](img/v6-2/tabpos.png)

### New UX in object multi-selection (eg used by the associate/pillbox dialog)

- Added a preview of selected items on the right side of dialog
- Allows to do several searches without losing previous selections
- Allows to easily remove all or each item

![](img/v6-2/selobj.png)

- Optimized menu calls to update counters using a new search service with forced group-by by enum

```javascript
obj.search({}, { groupby: true, groupbyfields: ["myEnumField"] })
.then(list => ...}
```

### New **end-user's dashboards**

- New group `DASHBOARD_MAKER` to build business dashboards
- New shortcut granted to group `DASHBOARD` to access the dashboards overview
- `DASHBOARD_MAKER` can edit its own dashboards, rename and delete
- It can also share them with other groups (with new group type `dashboard sharing`)

![](img/v6-2/dashboard.png)

![](img/v6-2/dashedit.png)

### New user's filters on View

- Allows to add a search bar (new view item) with optional time period and fields
- The item triggers a new event with users's filters `{ fromDate, toDate, fields... }`
- The filters are applied to lists, charts and pivot tables (having a date/period or matching filtered fields)
- External objects have to implement a new handler when they are concerned by filters
- New front helper to apply view's filters to a business object: `obj.applyFilters(filters)`

For example:

```javascript
$("#myWidget")
  .addClass("js-view-filters")
  .on("ui.view.filters", (e, filters) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    // Apply the filters to widget components
    myobj.applyFilters(filters);
    // Redraw the widget
    myWidget.render();
  });
```

![](img/v6-2/viewfilter.png)

- Improved UX for editing resources and print templates (and deprecated print templates using UI templates)

### Added `SAVE_BEFORE_QUIT_PROCESS` dialog on process activity with several choices

- `Save` the current form/activity
- `Quit` the activity but keep the process in memory
- `Abandon` the process
- `Cancel` : stay on the current activity

![](img/v6-2/wkfquit.png)

- Color picker has been upgraded to `spectrum-colorpicker2` v2.0.10

- New style helper on `Action` form:
  - to preview a generated button with selected colors
  - to check the level AAA of WCAG contrast (minimum 4.5)

![](img/v6-2/actcontrast.png)
![](img/v6-2/actcontrast2.png)

- New style helper on `List code` form:

![](img/v6-2/lovcontrast.png)

### Removed ajax call within constraints on UI

- `[SYSPARAM:name]` is now replaced with session parameter `app.sysparams['name']`
- `[PARAM:name]` is replaced with the instance local parameter `obj.locals['name']`

### `Bookmarks` on list

- The record bookmark can be displayed on list item in button options
- The list can be filtered on "my bookmarks" only

![](img/v6-2/bm.png)

![](img/v6-2/bmlist.png)

- `Redolog` panel merges children changes in the parent object

Ex: product changes are visible with the supplier changes

- Updated vulnerable JFreeChart Java lib and BootBox and Vue additional JS libs
- Fixed import specification file reading when calling it from the I/O endpoint using the `modulesimport` service
- The ping endpoint (`/ping`) is now reading the protected `PATCH_LEVEL` system parameter (instead of the `VERSION` that may be deleted)
  this avoids potentially falsely negative ping responses.
- Fixed NN pillbox with create context in case of copy
- Backported [from v7.0](v7-0#optional-importspec-version) change on the `version` to be optional (if not present no version check is done).
  Note that the improvement on the Git tag has not been backported.
- Updated vulnerable JGit (and associated Apache sshd) Java libs and XTerm additional JS lib
- Module filter: allows system fields on permission
- Prevented permalinks to match platform URIs
- Fixed missing `initUpdate` on state transition from a row action on list
