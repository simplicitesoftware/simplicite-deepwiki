Agenda
====================
Setting up a calendar view is done via the **Interface/Agenda** V5 menu or **User interface/Objects rendering/Agendas** or from the **Agendas** tab on a business object form.  
Setting up a calendar is possible as soon as the object you want to display in calendar view has one or more dates in its configuration.  
Simplicit√© uses the opensource plugin <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/" target="_blank">FullCalendar</a> for this calendar view.  
For information about the version and libraries used, see the **FULLCALENDAR_LIBS** and **FULLCALENDAR_VERSION** system settings.  
V3,V4 and V5 versions of FullCalendar are integrated.  

The calendar uses a particular instance of the object.  
The **initAgenda** hook is used to override the standard calendar behavior.  



Exercise
