# Static Text

## What is a Static Text?
In Simplicité, a **Static Text** represents a block of text or HTML content that can be displayed in various parts of the application UI or logs. It is primarily used to present information, instructions, or custom content that remains fixed, without relying on application data or dynamic behavior.  

Static Texts can be embedded in views, forms, or logs to improve the user experience and provide contextual guidance or explanations that stay consistent regardless of the application's state or data.  

Additionally, Static Texts can serve as predefined message codes that can be referenced in the application logic. For example, you can call:  
```java
Message.formatSimpleInfo(getGrant().T("MY_MESSAGE"));
```
