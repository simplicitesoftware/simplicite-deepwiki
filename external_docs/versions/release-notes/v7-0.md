Version 7.0 release note
========================

:::warning

It means it is **absolutely not yet suitable** for production or even just for testing.
:::

:::info
**Note** This release note is also in its early stage redaction.

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

Among the reasons for this version to be the first minor version of a new **major** version are the changes at the level of the underlying technical components:

- JVM level
- Tomcat version

### JVM related

The platform is now compiled at **JVM level 21**(vs 17 for previous major version 6 and 11 for previous major version 5).

This has no impact except if you where using in your some some Java APIs marked as deprecated for several Java versions
and that may have been finally removed from the JVM.

:::note
Our `latest` Docker images are built with a JVM 21 since major version 5, if you had deprecated Java APIs usage
in your code you should have already seen it as warnings or errors when compiling your code within the platform
and thus should not be impacted by the JVM level change at platform level.
:::

### Tomcat related

The target Tomcat version for major version 7 is now 11.

**To be completed**

### Third party libs related

Some **outdated third party Java libs** have been removed:

- the outdated Apache commons `commons-discovery` library
- the legacy Apache commons `commons-fileupload` v1 library (note that the `commons-fileupload2-*` v2 libraries are present since major version 5)
- **To be completed**

:::tip
If you use them in your code and can't refactor their usage you can still re-add them specifically.
:::

### Long text fields behavior vs truncation

- `FeatureFlag.TRUNCATE_TOO_LONG_TEXT` is set to `false` by default.
  - the UX/UI is not impacted because field inputs are already limited to the max size
  - but the API create/update will get an error if a data is too long (against data truncation in 6.3)

Deprecations
------------

### JVM related

All JVM core APIs marked as deprecated since version 17 **should** be refactored in your code as of now if you use them
in order to avoid potential JVM-level compatibility breaking change in the future (see above).

### Docker images

There is no impact if you use out of the box images.

If you customize these images at Tomcat level there might be some impacts because the version 7.x images are using Tomcat 11 which
configuration files may slightly differ from Tomcat 9 used in previous versions' images.
Make sure to review, and potentially adapt, your customization Dockerfiles.
