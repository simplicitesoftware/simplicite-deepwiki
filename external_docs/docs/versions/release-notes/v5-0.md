Version 5.0.x release note
==========================

:::danger
**Warning**: This legacy minor version is **not maintained anymore**. Make sure you upgrade to the current minor version.
:::

JVM
---

As of this minor version, due to third party dependencies, the platform is compiled with a **OpenJDK version 11**.

The platform is thus **not** compliant any longer with any JVM **prior** to version 11, the legacy JVM version 1.8 in particular is not supported.

This means the recommended JVM to run the platform is still an **up to date JVM**, but **at least** an JVM version 11.

> **Note**: A **fatal** exception is now thrown if you use a unsupported JVM, preventing the webapp to start.

Rhino
-----

Implementing server side logic (hooks) using the Rhino (server-side Javascript) is now considered **deprecated**,
this possibility will be removed in next major version (v6), then only Java server logic will be possible.

Converting your existing Rhino scripts to Java class is thus highly recommended.

Bootstrap
---------

- **Bootstrap v4** has been added to replace V3
- New system parameter `BOOTSTRAP_VERSION`:
	- is set to 4 by default to use the new disposition `responsive5` based on Bootstrap v4
	- can be set to 3 for backward compatibility (or during your migration)
- Bootstrap v3 has been upgraded from 3.3.7 to 3.4.1: this maintenance version is supposed to fix issues (XSS)

See documentation to migrate your specific V3 components to V4 (https://getbootstrap.com/4.0/migration).

It is strongly recommended to use the helpers `$ui.view.tools` to ignore the rendering implementation/version.
For example, `$ui.view.tools.panel` will use a `<panel/>` in V3 and a `<card/>` in V4.

FullCalendar
------------

Both versions V3 and V4 are included in the platform:
- Use the parameter `FULLCALENDAR_VERSION` to set the version to use (3 or 4),
- For backward compatibility the parameter is set to 3 by default,
- See https://fullcalendar.io/upgrading-from-v3 to upgrade your specific usage before migrating to FullCalendar v4.
- Set optionally the parameter `FULLCALENDAR_LIBS` for additional plugins

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

- The methods of `RESTServiceExternalObject` and `RESTMappedObjectsExternalObject` are now **public**
  instead of **protected**, if you have overridden them as protected you must now set them as public (if you don't do so
  you will have compilation issues).
- The grant hooks' `parseAuth` method is now called also for LDAP, OAuth2 and SAML authentication provider and it has a new interface.
  And it now takes session info as second argument instead of auth string in the previous versions' hook.
	- If you have implemented some logic assuming this hook is only called for server managed or custom authentication
	  you **should** refactor your code by testing the authentication provider.
	- If you still have an implementation with a plain string as second argument you **must** refactor it before upgrading.
- The extended title of object does not support the old syntax [field] any more (the supported syntax is [VALUE:field] since V3.0)
- The `GrantHooks` is **deprecated** but will be supported for backward compatibility in this version
  however it **must** be refactored to the new shared script `PlatformHooks` to use non-static methods:

```java
/**
 * Platform Hooks
 */
public class PlatformHooks extends PlatformHooksInterface {
	public String parseAuth(Grant sys, SessionInfo info) {
		// same method but not static...
	}
	public boolean isMenuEnable(Grant g, String domain, String item) {
		// same method but not static...
	}
}
```

- The internal `GitTool` toolbox class is now a singleton, no backward compatibility is implemented with legacy static methods
  as a matter of fact this toolbox should not be used by many application code and refactoring is very easy
  (change `GitTool.(...)` to `GitTool.getInstance().(...)`)
- Legacy `WebZone` are not supported anymore:
  - Extra zone, sub-head, public zones... are not loaded by the responsive UI
  - designer has to move the legacy logon addons to the new resource `LOGON_ADDON` of responsive disposition
  - all other zones have to be migrated to other resources (MENU, HEADER, FOOTER...) of disposition
- Ends of SQL `inner join` on all required foreign-keys:
	- Replaced by a `left outer join` to display potential dead links on UI, users will have to delete or fix the relationships
	- Only batch instances (during data import/export) will still use `inner join` for integrity reasons
	- Allows hooks/constraints to change the required property on foreign-key without perturbing the search/count result

Core changes
------------

- Upgraded third party libs
- New action to rebuild all thumbnails of image field
- No more legacy classes to build the old UI based on iframe:
	- ObjectForm, ObjectList, ObjectSearch... have been removed
	- Legacy external objects have been deleted: `ChangePassword`, `ModuleDelete`, `FieldEditList`, `EditConstraints` and `HomeModels`
	- Some components are still alive: modeler based on Canvas, Gmap.js
- ALMTest has been removed because emulate legacy UI, and ALMPlan will be optional but not installed by default
- Legacy `Graph` has been removed from the platform and related behaviors (jFreeChart.jar, Graph item in View, CONTEXT_GRAPH...)
- Added debug setting for Simplicité service objects
- `DBAccess` and `DBDOCAccess` have been refactored to responsive UI
- Added new `preAuth/postAuth` grant hooks to implement custom rules before and on successful or failed local authentication attempts
  (these hooks are not used in case of external authentication: SAML, OAuth2, ...)
- Added unit test type shared code (exposed as tests in modules' Maven projects), runnable from the UI or API within the context of the platform
- Added a JMX MBean (management bean) to read system info and to apply a global clear cache.
- Improved URI mapping applying changes also at API session valve level by configuring a dedicated URI filtering pattern.
- Added salt on internal passwords
- Export to Excel/CSV optimizations to support huge data without memory overflow. `ExcelPOITool` is deprecated, now `ExcelTool` uses buffered export.
- Added a new system parameter `PUBLIC_SESSION_TIMEOUT` to adjust public session' timeout (defaults to 5 min)
- Validation of `Integer` and `Decimal` fields supports `Field type` for additional Regexp or Method, for example to check a positive value

- Object search with page callback to preserve memory usage during a huge search of records
	- in this case object current list is not set because the heap will be free on each page
	- calculated fields and `postSearch` are called on each page before calling the callback

```java
obj.resetFilters(); // a full scan of a big table
// New search with page callback
obj.search(true, 100, (rows) -> {
	// Called on each page of max 100 records
	for (String[] row : rows) {
		// do something with the record
	}
});
```

- New Websocket event `clearCache` used during a partial clear cache to clean the designer's UI, by removing client-side cache to force a full reload of object metadata.
- Added Redis&reg; cache toolbox `RedisTool`
- Added Trello&reg; API toolbox `TrelloTool`
- Added Slack&reg; API toolbox `SlackTool`
- If a module's URL is a GitHub or GitLab repo URL, the setting is interpreted as a Git setting
- Added `GrantHook.socialPost` triggered when a social post is created/updated

- **Multi-documents** on field related to a DocIndex to set quota (min/max) and accepted mime-types
- `getNextIdForColumn` supports sequence on Oracle and PostgreSQL
- Allows to filter date with `is null` / `is not null`

- New system parameter `USE_OBJECT_USAGE` = yes:
	- to notify user when object is currently opened with update rights (or deleted) by other people
	- with new object `ObjectUsage` (in Operation menu) to manage "who is updating what at the same time"
	- with blocking timestamp on object: only one user can access with update rights to a record on UI form

![](img/v5-0/blocking.png)

- New helper `BusinessObjectTool.selectValidateAndSave` in a thread-safe block:
	- to force access rights to business object
	- to select a record or copy
	- to set values from a Map or a JSONObject
	- to validate as usual
	- to save with or without the timestamp checking/update
	- to restore rights

- `postDelete` and `postDeleteAll` ability to return info/warning or redirect statement
- Min/max rows per object: new properties to override the default min/max of user's profile (when greater than 0, if not set the list will use the profile values)
- `obj.setValues(row)` has been revised to set the old values by default
- New parameter `COMPLETION_SIZE` for list size of field with auto-completion (default value 15)
- Limited REST API mapping for select objects and hidable objects/attributes from schemas

- `DocuSign`: client libs isolation to avoid dependency issues with more recent `javax.ws.rs` implementation
- Allows to load on-the-fly external **JDBC driver** to connect external database:
	- without adding it to your `tomcat/lib`
	- as a shared script (type lib/jar) loaded in the platform dynamic classloader
	- or thru an external jar loaded in one isolated classloader:
		- to avoid versions conflict between multi-datasources (i.e. many Oracle drivers)
		- new `jdbc` property to indicate the local JAR path to load, for example:

```json
{
    "driver": "org.postgresql.Driver",
    "username": "<user>",
    "password": "<pwd>",
    "url": "postgresql://<server>:<port>/<database>",
	"jdbc": "/usr/share/java/postgresql-42.2.9.jar"
}
```

- New **ClassLoaders** panel in monitoring to check loaded libs at different level:
	- Server: tomcat/lib content
	- Webapp:  WEB-INF/lib content
	- Simplicité core-cache with all dynamic modules (with compiled hooks) and shared libs (JAR shared script)
	- Extended classloaders: to isolate external datasource, docusign...

![](img/v5-0/cl.png)

- List optimization to get less metadata on each row

- New hook `getExportFileName` to override the file name during data export, for example:

```java
@Override
public String getExportFileName(String type, String name, String row[]) {
	if (HTTPTool.MEDIA_XLSX.equals(type) && row!=null)
		return "EXPORT" + "-" + row[getfieldIndex("myfield")] + "-" + Tool.getCurrentDate();
	return getDisplay();
}
```

- New hook `isMergeEnable` to check if the selected ids are mergeable:

```java
@Override
public String isMergeEnable(List<String> ids) {
    if ( /* rule1... */ )
       return "ERR_NOT_ALLOWED_RULE1";
    return null; // OK
}
```

- It is now possible to retrieve logs using the I/O endpoint
- The duration (for session timeouts and user  token durations) can now be expressed with a duration syntax (e.g. `24h` or `1d`).
  Supported qualifiers are: `s` seconds, `m` minutes, `h` hours, `d`days. The default unit is still valid
  (minutes for session timeouts and hours for user token)

- New abstract business object `SimpleUser`
	- with internal business logic and implemented by `User`
	- to simplify UI overriding in a specific inheritance

- New precision on document field
	- to limit upload size per field (ex `max=10`)
	- System param `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` in always the global limit and each field (precision must be smaller)

- Predefined search with list preferences
	- supports preferences of visible fields on list
	- new hook `pre/postSavePredefinedSearch` when a private search is updated
	- new hook `getPredefinedSearches` to filter accessible searches
	- separate edit and usage by setting or calling `setPredefSearch(use, edit)`
	- direct access to predefined searches on list (dropdown control) `setPredefSearchOnList(boolean)`

![](img/v5-0/predef.png)

![](img/v5-0/predefsearch.png)

- Optimization: avoid double calls of `initRefSelect` and `initAssociate`
- New accessors `setPredefSearchOnList` and `isPredefSearchOnList` to enable fast access to predefined searches on list
- `public` session uses the URL parameter `_lang` or the `Accept-Language` if present in HTTP header to override the default language of this user
- Added SAML property to use a JKS or PKCS12 keystore file for the SP and/or IdP certificates and private keys
- Added filter to set custom HTTP headers configured in the `HTTP_HEADERS` system parameters,
  typical usage is to add security-related headers such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, ...
- Added action to generate the default typical resources of a UI component external object: HTML (`HTML`), JavaScript (`SCRIPT`) and CSS (`STYLES`)
- Supports Google Firebase JS 7.20.0
- Supports depth=0 on reflexive link to show the closed roots only
- Action with confirm fields supports documents
	- old syntax with `Map` is deprecated `public String myAction(Map<String,String> params)` but supported for simple fields (values as String)
	- and replaced by new syntax `public String myAction(Action action)` to access Action's fields directly:

```java
public String myAction(Action action) {
	String param = action.getConfirmField("myStringField").getValue();
	ObjectField myDocField = action.getConfirmField("myDocField");
	DocumentDB doc = myDocField.getDocument();
	AppLog.info(getClass(), "myAction", "DOCUMENT " + doc, getGrant());
	if (doc!=null) {
		// Uploaded tmp file
		java.io.File file = doc.getUploadFile();
		AppLog.info(getClass(), "myAction", "DOCUMENT FILE " + file, getGrant());
		// do something with the document...
		// Remove the file from /tmp directory
		file.delete();
	}
	return null;
}
```

- Fulltext search:
	- `preSearchIndex` and `postSearch` with new contextual parameters
	- call the hook `getTargetObjet` to return child objects in case of inheritance

- Optim fulltext search on PostgreSQL
- Backported core directories checksum verification at startup
- Backported new business object hooks: `preCount`, `preCrosstabSearch` and `postCrosstabSearch`,
  for backward compatibility these hooks calls `pre/postSearch` by default

UI changes
----------

- No more access to the legacy UI
- No backward compatibility on .jsp wrapper and old UI javascript
- New disposition resource `LOGON_ADDON` (to replace the legacy webzone)

- Optim: icon picker loads only the visible tabs

- XSS security: new jQuery selector `:safeAttr` to clean element attributes
	- remove all dom events `onload`, `onfocus`...
	- remove all attributes containing `javascript:`
	- example `$("img:safeAttr")` will prevent img loading with malicious `onload` callback

- New integer rendering:
	- slider: input range with the new precision parameters `min`, `max` and `step`
	- stars: rate bar where precision = nb of stars

List:

![](img/v5-0/slider.png)

Form:

![](img/v5-0/slider2.png)

- New client hooks:
	- before rendering a list or a form when data are loaded
		- `list.preload(ctn, obj, params)`
		- `form.preload(ctn, obj, params)`
	- when a list row is displayed:
		- `list.onloadrow(ctn, obj, id, item, tr)`: to bind events on input fields, change the rendering...
		- `list.onunloadrow(ctn, obj, id, item, tr)`: to destroy specific field component before unloading the list
		- for example to apply field `change` on both form and edit list:

```javascript
(function(ui) {
	var app = ui.getAjax();
	Simplicite.UI.hooks.MyObject = function(o, cbk) {
		function bind(ctn,obj,id) {
			var myField = ui.getUIField(ctn, obj, "myField", id);
			myField && myField.ui.on("change", function() {
				var myField2 = ui.getUIField(ctn, obj, "myField2", id);
				myField2 && myField2.ui.val(myField.ui.val() > 1000 ? "big" : "small");
			});
		}
		try {
			var p = o.locals.ui;
			p.form.onload = function(ctn, obj) {
				bind(ctn,obj);
			};
			p.list.onloadrow = function(ctn, obj, id, item, tr) {
				bind(ctn,obj,id);
			};
		} catch(e) {
				app.error("Error in Simplicite.UI.hooks",e);
		} finally {
			cbk && cbk();
		}
	};
})(window.$ui);
```

	- to drag&drop documents into the field container
	- to limit mime-types or file extensions in the accept files (pdf, image...)
	- to use quota on field: min and max uploaded documents

List column:

![](img/v5-0/mdocs_list.png)

Form rendering of thumbnails:

![](img/v5-0/mdocs_form.png)

Drag&drop to upload N files:

![](img/v5-0/mdocs_upload.png)

- Grouped list: title with the search count and the number of groups

- Object usage interface when `USE_OBJECT_USAGE` = yes
  - See people using the object with update rights:

  ![](img/v5-0/objusage.png)

  - And when object has a blocking timestamp:
    - If user has the lock, the form add a lock icon in header:

    ![](img/v5-0/objusage3.png)

    - If user hasn't the lock, the form is in read-only with the lock owner in header:

    ![](img/v5-0/objusage4.png)

- Linked lists on search (dialog and columns)
- New action to reset all datamap fields
- External object in form template:
	- insert easily an external object into the object form
	- new syntax `<div class="extern" data-extern="extobjname"/>` with options:
		- `data-embedded="true"` to insert the object without panel/card
		- `data-title="false"` to hide the object title (default is true)
		- `data-iframe="true"` to load the object in a embedded iframe

- New timesheet rendering with:
	- Input data grid with colored resources
	- Bottom chart to see the workload in time
	- Gantt view: coming soon

![](img/v5-0/timesheet.png)

- Integrated **Swagger UI** libs + used in the API tester page and as publication for module
- Added static site external object helper `com.simplicite.webapp/web/StaticSiteExternalObject`
  to expose a whole static web site (HTML/CSS/JS/images) provided as a single file set (ZIP) resource

- New globals parameters:
	- `Simplicite.UI.Globals.compact`: compacted mode to gain height (default false)
	- `Simplicite.UI.Globals.fontSize`: specify the default font-size at top level (default = 100%)
	- accessible to user with parameters `USE_COMPACT = yes` and `USE_ZOOM = yes`

![](img/v5-0/compact.png)

Example of compacted Order:

![](img/v5-0/compact2.png)

- CSS sizing:
	- this version uses flexbox instead of floating or inlined blocks
	- `px` sizing have been replaced by `rem` on responsive elements (menu width, font-size, margin, padding...)
	- designers have to migrate the specific `px` in less/css resources
	- the rule `1rem = 16px` is simple to apply using this tips without recalculation:

```less
@px: 16rem;
.myclass {
  /* font-size: 16px; */
  font-size: 16/@px; /* will generate 1rem */
  /* padding: 20px; */
  padding: 20/@px; /* will generate 1.25rem */
}
```

- New front APIs to change the page sizing:
	- `$ui.view.zoom(prct)` to change the global font-size and related rem elements (ex: "110%")
	- `$ui.view.compact(ctn, enable)` to apply a compact mode to a container (default = body)
		- reduce some margin/padding height
		- show label and input field horizontally
		- can be changed thru the top level class `.compact`

- The compact mode can be specified on `Theme` definition and `Field area` (template editor)

- `Simplicite.UI.Globals.onlogout()` new optional handler to override the Quit button which calls `$ui.logout({ confirm: true })` by default

For example:

```javascript
$(document).on("ui.ready", function() {
	$ui.options.onlogout = function() {
		var app = $ui.getAjax(),
			login = app.grant.login;
		// Save the session (navigation...)
		$ui.saveSession(function() {
			alert("Bye " + login + "!");
			// Call a SSO service
			$.ajax({
				url: app.sysparams.MY_SSO_LOGOUT_URL + "?user=" + encodeURIComponent(login)
			});
			$ui.quit(); // to invalidate session
		});
	};
});
```

	- Supports also horizontal swipe on touch device

- Change user's language:
	- Switch easily the current language thru user's profile in header
	- By default all installed languages will be accessible to all users with `grant.getLanguages()`
