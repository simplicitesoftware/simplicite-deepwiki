Version 7.0 release note
========================

:::danger[Warning]

This release note corresponds to the **future** first minor version of the **next** major version 7.

It is in **EARLY ALPHA** heavy development stage. It means it is **ABSOLUTELY not yet suitable for production**
nor just for development and testing.

This release note is also in its early redaction stage.

:::

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

Among the reasons for this version to be the first minor version of a new **major** version are the changes
at the level of the underlying technical components:

- JVM level
- Tomcat version

### JVM related

The platform is now compiled at **JVM level 21** (vs 17 for previous major version 6 and 11 for previous major version 5).

There is no impact unless certain Java APIs, which have been deprecated for several versions and may have been removed
from the JVM, are used.

:::note

The `latest` Docker images have been built with JVM 21+ since major version 6 (JVM 25 for this major version 7).
Deprecated Java API usage would already have resulted in compilation warnings or errors within the platform; therefore,
the JVM level change at platform level should not have further impact.

:::

### Tomcat related

The target Tomcat version for major version 7 is now **Tomcat 11**.

Tomcat 11 uses Jakarta EE 11 instead of JEE 8, which was used in previous Simplicité version's Tomcat 9 target.
As a result, imports such as `javax.servlet.*` **must** be updated to `jakarta.servlet.*`.

Typically, the usage of these packages occurs in the following platform hooks: `customStartPage`, `customErrorResponse`, and `customAuth/customAuthPage`.

:::warning

For customized Docker images at the Tomcat level, note that version 7.x images use Tomcat 11, which may have slight differences
in configuration files compared to Tomcat 9 used previously. Review and adapt customization Dockerfiles as necessary.

:::

### Third party components related

#### Server-side components

##### Updated libs

The following **outdated third party Java libs** have been **removed**:

- legacy Apache commons `commons-lang` library,
  note that the `commons-lang3` library is present since major version 5
- legacy Apache commons `commons-collections` library,
  note that the `commons-collections4` library is present since major version 5
- legacy Apache commons `commons-fileupload` library,
  note that the `commons-fileupload2-*` libraries are present since major version 5

:::tip

If these libraries are required and refactoring is not possible, they may be re-added as needed.

:::

##### Removed iText lib

As announced in the [version v6.2 release note](v6-2#deprecated-features) (and recalled in the [version v6.3 release note](v6-3#deprecations)):

- The legacy **iText** libraries have been removed and the associated helpers `PDFTool` and `PDFDocumentExternalObject`
  have been completely refactored to use the PDFBox libraries.
  Any code written for iText and/or with the help of the above helper classes **must** be rewritten accordingly.

##### Removed grant hooks

As announced in the [version v6.3 release note](v6-3#deprecations):

- All classes related to legacy grant hooks have been removed. Grant hooks have been deprecated since major version 5
  in favor of platform hooks, the refactoring of user session level logic to `PlatformHooks` should have already been done.

#### Client-side components

##### Librairies locations changes

The historical locations of Bootstrap libs have (finally) been changed.

This **may** have an impact only if included specifically using hardcoded paths (e.g. in a standalone external object page).

This should not be the case, as Java methods are provided to include these libraries properly without requiring knowledge
of their locations (see below).

:::tip

There is no reason to re-include these Bootstrap libs specifically within a custom component
of the **generic UI** because they are already included.

:::

The changed locations are:

- Bootstrap: `/scripts/jquery/bootstrap5/*` to `/scripts/bootstrap5/*`
  (the Java methods `HTMLTool.bootstrapJS/bootstrapCSS` should be used instead of hardcoded paths).
- Bootstrap date/datetime picker: `/scripts/jquery/bootstrap5-datetimepicker/*` to `/scripts/bootstrap5-datetimepicker/*`
  (the Java methods `HTMLTool.bootstrapDatetimePickerJS/bootstrapDatetimePickerCSS` should be used instead of hardcoded paths).

##### Removed GoogleMaps helper lib

As announced in the [version v6.3 release note](v6-3#deprecations):

The deprecated **GoogleMap** helper JS tool `gmap.js` has been removed. Custom code relying on this tool should be refactored
to use the **Leaflet** helper JS tool, which provides an abstraction layer over map service providers.

Note that existing GoogleMaps inclusion methods continue to include the GoogleMaps JS library,
but code relying on helper functions from `gmap.js` may require refactoring to use the GoogleMaps JS API directly.

##### Removed legacy ChartJS

- The legacy **ChartJS** version 2 has be removed, as is the support for legacy version 3 in the standard charts.
  The standard charts now use version 4 only. Any custom code written for legacy version 3 (or 2) should be refactored for version 4.

### Security-related

After several security audit it appears some of the highly recommended [security guidelines](/docs/security) are not always taken into account
in production which leads to unintentional potential risks.

Therefore it has been decided to change some elements to be more **secure by default**.

These changes requires some explicit configuration to get the same behavior as it was by default in previous versions.

#### Default value for security-related system parameters

The following system parameters have new default values:

- `USE_IO`: the default value is now `no` (no access to the I/O endpoint)
- `USE_IO_TESTER`: the default value is now `no` (no access to the I/O tester page)
- `USE_API_TESTER`: the default value is now `no` (no access to the API tester page)
- `HTTP_HEADER`: the default value now is the one indicated in the [security guidelines](/docs/security).
  This has an impact if you use JS scripts, CSS styles sheets, images, ... from external URLs.
  If so you should customize this system parameter (in particular the `Content-Security-Policy`) accordingly
  to your use case (see the description of the system parameter for the usual cases: GoogleFonts, OpenStreetMaps, ...).

:::tip[Reminder]

Any system parameter can be overridden by the corresponding environment variable `SIMPLICITE_<name of the system parameter>`.
They can also use `[ENV:<name of an environment variable>]` substitutions to be fully or partially overridden.

:::

#### Dev mode restrictions

Some additional features have been restricted to **development mode**:

- The `DBAccess` page is now only accessible when **in** development mode

### Long text fields behavior vs truncation

- `FeatureFlag.TRUNCATE_TOO_LONG_TEXT` is set to `false` by default.
  - the UX/UI is not impacted because field inputs are already limited to the max size
  - but the API create/update will get an error if a data is too long (against data truncation in 6.3)

### UI constant `Simplicite` refactored as ES module

The new ES module `Simplicite` has been refactored to clean its root data. Now the `Simplicite` interface contains only:

- `Simplicite.Globals` contains now all global variables from back-end: application infos `ROOT`, `URL`, `FULL_VERSION`, `ENDPOINT`...
  and user's common properties `LOGIN`, `LANG`, etc.
- `Simplicite.Application` has been preserved (same as `$app`) to contain all model constants: `CONTEXT_*`,
  field `TYPE_*`, `TRUE`/`FALSE`, etc.
- `Simplicite.Ajax`: unchanged namespace of model layer with ajax services to `Session`, `Grant`, `BusinessObject`,
  `BusinessProcess`, etc.
- `Simplicite.UI`: unchanged namespace of UI layer, controllers and viewers
- `Simplicite.Diagram`: SVG diagram modeler

### Unsupported Ajax service call with a callback function

As announced in 6.3 release notes, the function callback as (first) parameter are no more supported in Ajax services.
Those functions **should** be moved in a `then` statement before upgrading to V7.

Example for a search service:

```js
// Wrong syntax: this callback won't be called and filters not applied correctly
obj.search(list => { ... }, filters);
// Good syntax with promise since V6
obj.search(filters).then(list => { ... });
```

Deprecations
------------

### JVM level

All JVM core APIs marked as deprecated since version 17 **should** be refactored to prevent future potential
JVM-level compatibility issues (see above).

### TinyMCE V6

This old version of this HTML editor is not maintained anymore and the latest version 8 is only for commercial usage.
The UI will now use the open-source Quill (see below).

Features
--------

### Clipboard-able fields

Added a "Copy to Clipboard" setting for _Long Text_ and _HTML Content_ fields.
Click the **clipboard** icon next to these fields to copy their visible content.

Enhancements
------------

### Mentioned notification

A mentioned user (@user) will receive a notification (`SocialPostMention` notification) when a post is created.

:::note

Notification channels / content can be overridden via User interaction > Notifications > Notifications > SocialPostMention.

:::

### Flatpicker datetime picker

Date-time picker has been replaced by [flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org):

- previous one can be loaded but is deprecated
- `flatpickr` supports dark/light themes with many features: pick a period, or several dates/times, exclude dates, show 2 months...
- plugins have been added to show buttons (today/now, reset, close), and to pick a year or a month directly
  according to the field rendering,
- manage focus and toggle button for accessibility, arrow keys to change day (+ctrl to change month/year), enter/esc,
- `flatpickr(input, options)` can be used directly in specific input/component
- and the API `UIFieldDatetime.datePicker` to get an input group with a date-picker is still compatible with previous implementation:

```js
/**
 * Get a datepicker input-group
 * @param ctn optional container to append the picker (default is the input-group)
 * @param options options
 * @param options.input optional input element (create one if not specified)
 * @param options.type $ui.TYPE_DATE (default) or $ui.TYPE_DATETIME or $ui.TYPE_TIME
 * @param options.rendering optional field rendering
 * @param options.autoopen true to open the picker on click
 * @param options.clear true to add a clear button
 * @returns input group with input and buttons
 * @function
 */
UIFieldDatetime.datePicker(ctn: Container | null, options?: {
		input?: JQuery,
		type?: number,
		rendering?: string,
		autoopen?: boolean,
		clear?: boolean
	}): JQuery;
```

Maker Experience
----------------

### Source file search

Integrated a search bar in the code editor to find a specific source file

![code-editor-search](img/v7-0/code-editor-search.png)

Technical
----------

### Quill editor

HTML editor `TinyMCE` has been replaced by [Quill V2](https://quilljs.com)

- With new `$ui.options.quillOptions` to define the default toolbar, with the theme `snow`
- `$ui.options.tinymceOptions` and the loader `$ui.loadTinyMCE()` still load the `TinyMCE V6`, but they are now deprecated
  and no more used by the generic UI.

![quill](img/v7-0/quill.png)

Basic usage in your UI component (external object, hooks...):

```js
$factory.Quill().then(Quill => {
  // Set value with DOM content
  const div = $("#mydiv").empty();
	const quill = new Quill(div[0], { theme: 'snow' });
	const delta = quill.clipboard.convert({ html: "<p>Hello world</p>" });
	quill.updateContents(delta, "silent");
  div.data("quill", quill); // attach the quill instance for further usage
});

// ... and later to get HTML from editor
const html = $("#mydiv").data("quill").getSemanticHTML();
```

### JDBC drivers location

The JDBC drivers JAR are now located in the webapp's `WEB-INF/lib` along with other 3rd party libs.

They have therefore been removed from the pre-configured Tomcat 11 package used on the SIM servers
and embedded in our standard Docker images.

### Optional importspec version

The `version` attribute can now be omitted to avoid version check. If the attribute is absent the import is processed regardless
of the current version of the module if already imported.

This can be useful, for instance, to force the re-import of a module.

### Git tag importspec

When the import specification of a module uses a Git repository the `version` attribute (if set) is now used to find a Git tag:

- if the Git tag specified on the `version` attribute is found, the import is done on the tag
  (note that the cloned Git repository is then in **"detached HEAD" state** on which no commit, push or pull is possible,
  you can still delete it if needed).
- if the Git tag specified on the `version` attribute is not found in the repository, an error is raised
- if no `version` attribute is specified, the repository is checked out on the head

### External objects HTTP headers

It is now possible to add custom HTTP headers to the external objet's response
(the related methods are `addHTTPHeaders`, `removeHTTPHeaders` and `getHTTPHeaders`).

Note that these headers are added after the platform sets the content type &nd cache-related headers,
so only set such headers as custom headers if you know exactly what you are doing.

### JSON schema tools improvements

The `JSONSchemaTool` JSON schema helper class now has a constructor with an explicit JSON schema version argument (`VERSION_*` constants).
The **default** constructor now uses by default the _Draft v7_  JSON schema version
