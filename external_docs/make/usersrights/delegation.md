# Delegation 

## What is Delegation ?

It often happens that when a person is absent or on leave, they need to delegate their rights to a third party for a given period. This is known as delegating rights.  
This delegation can be configured in Simplicité and, like all system functions, can be assigned to a [business profile](/make/usersrights/groups).    

## How to create a Delegation ?

To create a delegation, follow the steps below: 

1. Go to Users and rights > Delegation.
2. Click **Create** a new Delegation.

    - Start date - Beginning date of the delegation. 
    - End date (optional) – End date of the delegation.

A user can have several rights delegations.
