Version 5.3.x release note
==========================

:::warning
**Warning**: This minor version is the **last** version 5 minor version of major version 5.

Major version 5 is now in its **long term maintenance** period, please consider upgrading to the current major version 6.
:::

Compatibility breaking changes
------------------------------

### Bootstrap V5

- Bootstrap V4 is still the default renderer in release V5.x
- Bootstrap V5 `BOOTSTRAP_VERSION = 5` is supported since release V5.3 and will be the default at major release V6
- The disposition `responsive5` supports the 2 implementations
- `jQuery` is still supported to wrap constructor/events (but Bootstrap 5 uses pure javascript)
- Migration doc for specific front: https://getbootstrap.com/5.1/migration

### ECMAScript

- This version uses common ES6/7 features (const, let, lambda, promise, async/await...)
- IE11 is not supported anymore by all UI components

### ChartJS version 3

- `Chart.js` has been upgraded to V3 but V2 will be supported in all release V5
- Set the parameter `CHARTJS_VERSION` to specify the version 2 or 3
- The location of the chartjs libs has changed to `scripts/chartjs/v2` and `scripts/chartjs/v3`
- Migration guide for your specific charts: https://www.chartjs.org/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html

### Marked version 4

- `Marked` JavaScript lib has been upgraded from version 3.x.y to version 4.x.y
- If you use it in your custom JS code you need to upgrade calls like `marked(...)` to `marked.parse(...)`

### FullCalendar version 5

- FullCalendar version 3 is now **deprecated** and will be removed in the next minor release (you can still use version 3 but you now **must**
  consider migrating your custom code to version 5 or at least version 4, see bellow)
- `FULLCALENDAR_VERSION` is now set to version 5 by default.
  Version 4 is still supported but you **should** consider migrating your custom code to FullCalendar version 5.

To upgrade your specific code see https://fullcalendar.io/upgrading-from-v3 or https://fullcalendar.io/upgrading-from-v4

### Export to XLSX

- The data export to XLSX format is now only implemented with Apache POI
- The legacy HTML format is deprecated/hidden by default, and will be removed in the next minor release

### Vue.js

The embedded Vue.js JS lib has been upgraded from version 2 to version 3. If you are using this lib in some of your custom components
you **must** refactor their code according to the [Vue 3 migration guide](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/).

### No more user-key on huge fields

For index size limitation, some field types cannot be functional-key anymore:
- document
- image
- html
- notepad (structured JSON)
- very long text (more than 4000 characters)

You will have to change these user-keys if any.

### Same-site cookie policy default

The instance template and Docker images are now configured to implement a `lax` same-site policy by default.
This `lax` value the appropriate value when using external OpenIDConnect/SAML authentication. If you don't use such external authentication yu can set it to `strict`.

You can revert to Tomcat's default by setting it to `unset` in the `CookieProcessor` block of the `META-INF/context.xml` descriptor (or by commenting this block).

### EasyModeAdapter deprecated

Old adapters to import legacy settings thru `quick param` (V3 tooling) has been removed, and related code is deprecated.

### Mail service configuration

The possibility to configure the mail service at Tomcat level (in the `context.xml` file) is not possible anymore as the implementation
of the mail tool has now switched to the new `jakarta.mail` package.

If you still use this kind of configuration (although it was strongly discouraged since v4.0),
make sure to move your mail service configuration to the `MAIL_SERVICE` system parameter.

Core changes
------------

- Added accessors `Grant.getResource` to find Resources by code, type and/or target object name
- Added `MailTool.convertImages` to replace in email all HTML inlined images `![](img/v5-3/pngbase64...)` with attachments and `![](img/v5-3/cid...)`
- The system parameter `USE_SOCIAL` has been removed, but still valued to true at logon if user has responsibility `SOCIAL_USER` or `SOCIAL_ADMIN` (for backward compatibility)
- Update of area position is synchronized in the object template
- Using an older webapp on an upgraded database is now causing a **FATAL** error that prevents platform
  to start up (this is to avoid unexpected side effects in this non supported case)
- New dedicated panel instance to merge links `Grant.getMergePanelObject` (against UI panel rules)
- Functional key property can be overridden in object field definition
- Bulk associate action added automatically in inherited links
- Associate a Bookshelf to any document field to specify accepted MIME types
- Simplify DocMIME functional key
- New adapter to import CSV with new lines support
	- `CSVAdapterOpen` based on Open CSV
- Import XML solves data-model cycle (not only reflexive errors)
- Rebuild automatically and asynchronously after a module import all objects DB indexes (UK+FKs) + data full-text indexes (m_index)

- New `DataLink` configuration to synchronize data between several applications
	- Set a list of named hosts with credentials to be accessed thru REST APIs
	- Define datalinks with primary/secondary hosts to synchronize objects changes
	- Master data updates are synchronized with other primaries/secondaries on the fly when systems are available
	- A new cron job `DataLink` is used as fallback when a system is down or temporarily unreachable
	- When operational again, it synchronizes all dataLinks with a primary from the last scan per object (stored in parameters `_SYNC_MASTER_<object>`)

![](img/v5-3/datalink.png)

- Added **experimental** platform annotations in the `com.simplicite.util.annotations` package
  these annotations have only "informative" function at that stage
  (using them also avoid false positive messages in some cases of code analysis)
  except for the `RESTServiceExternalObject` helper class which processes the `@RESTService*` annotations for building the OpenAPI/Swagger schema
  in the `openapi` hook default implementation/

- `CronManager.lock` robustness to re-affect the `CRON_LOCK`

- Added Apache Kafka client libs + experimental `KafkaTool` helper class
- Added license key file (`<project dir>/licenses/license.<xml|json|yaml>`) or environment variable (`LICENSE_KEY`) import at startup
- `initAction` with `getParentObject` context
- `initRefSelect` and `initDataMapSelect` with parent object set with DB old-values and UI current values
- Optimized asynchronous Data export of module

- Added a new property **Fixed filter** in field definition:
	- accessors `field.isFilterFixed()` and `field.setFilterFixed(fixed)`
	- `ObjectField.FIXED_FILTER_NOT` : default value, usual updatable end-user filter
	- `ObjectField.FIXED_FILTER_READ` : the filter is displayed on UI but in read-only
	- `ObjectField.FIXED_FILTER_HIDE` : the filter is hidden on UI

- New **Link filters** to specify filed filters on a panel search:
	- applied in the same time of the search specification SQL of link
	- useful to join heterogenous objects (from several datasources, object service...) when SQL is not permitted
	- JSON filters with common token, example:

```json
{
  "childField1" : ">=1000 and <=5000",
  "childField2" : "[VALUE:parentFieldName]",
  "order__childField3" : -1,
  "group__childField4" : 1
}
```

- New object hook `public String[] postSearchRow(String[] row)`:
	- Called on each record when fields are calculated and decrypted from DB
	- More efficient than a `postSearch` as it avoids a second loop over the records

- New type of `Action` to launch long running jobs started thru UI in a `isolated session`

- New message with **call to action** to ask the user to do something
	- action type must be hidden to be used only in this context
	- action is displayed only if the user is granted thru a function
	- action will call the front javascript or the back-end method

```java
// Single action
ObjectDB obj = this;
Action action = obj.getAction("MyAction_SendEmail");
return Message.formatCallToAction("WARNING", "Save is OK, do you want to send an email to client?", Message.WARN, null, obj, action);

// Or with several actions
List<Action> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(obj.getAction("MyAction_OptionA");
list.add(obj.getAction("MyAction_OptionB");
return Message.formatCallToAction("MYCODE", "What is the best option?", Message.WARN, null, obj, list);
```

![](img/v5-3/call-to-action.png)

- New `_tabId` in sessionStorage
	- to isolate objects of a same session (JSESSIONID) but accessed from different browser tabs
	- getter `Grant.getClientTabId()`

- New auto-incremental field
	- "Auto-incremental syntax" configuration field on Field object allows to automatically increment field value according to a specified syntax when creating a new record.

- Supports several Keycloak providers, names must start with `keycloak` to be identified in `AUTH_PROVIDERS`

- New monitoring of **JDBC pool size** (needs access to JMX/MBean)

![](img/v5-3/monitor_jdbc.png)

- New **Notification** feature
	- Is defined by an Object, an Action, a Condition, Channels, Recipients and Content
	- Object : Object that is linked to the Notification
	- Action (Create, Update, Delete) : Action on the Object that will trigger the Notification
	- Condition : Expression to define in which Condition(s) the Notification should be pushed
	- Content can be overridden for each Channel and / or Recipient
	- Channels are globally defined at the Notification level but can be specific to a given Recipient
	- Users can subscribe / unsubscribe from their Notifications (requires the Notification to be non-mandatory and user is a Recipient of the Notification)
		- Subscriptions are based on the Notification / Channel couple - meaning that for a given Notification broadcasted over Mail and Internal channels, a user can unsubscribe from the Mail channel.
	- *Channels* :
		- Internal : Bell icon in header updated when a new Notification is received - Notifications are stored in a system table
		- Mail : Sends an email to recipients configured in the Notification
		- Specific : Calls a method defined in the Object
	- *Recipients* :
		- User : specific user that will receive the Notification
		- Group : users with active Resp will receive the Notification
		- SQL : user ids or emails to receive the Notification

```
- Allows to create links within N,N pillbox during creation
	- stored in memory on form or edit-list object
	- then saved when the object is created

- `Simplicite.Ajax` with Class and Promises:
	- old syntax with a callback function as first parameter is still supported
	- new syntax calls return Promises, examples:
