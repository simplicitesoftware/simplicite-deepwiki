# State

## What is a State ? 
A state represents a step in the lifecycle of a Business Object. 

### Key features
A business object can have states that provide the following features:   
- Direct access to lists filtered by state via the menu    
- Grant-based state transitions (specific user groups (e.g., administrators) can be given rights to move an object to a previous or next state.)  
- Actions on state transitions (e.g. send email when an order moves to validated...etc.)    
- Execute business rules when an object enters a new state or during state transitions.  

## How to create a State ? 

### Prerequisites  
Before defining states, ensure the following conditions are met  
- the object must have **a simple enumerated field**(which will carry the state)
- this field must be **mandatory**
- the object **must not already have a state**

### Steps to create a State 

1. Define the State Field  
   - Select the Business Object whose going to follow a state model  
   - Create an enumerated field to store the State ([see Creating a Field](/tutorial/getting-started/attribute))  
   - Add possible values representing different states (e.g.: Draft, Approved, Rejected)   
   - Mark the field as Required  
2. State creation wizard  
 Once the object has an enumerated field and no state, a state model creation wizard can be accessed via the Add button and then Add State Model.

   - Configure automated actions translations on transitions.    
   ***Note:*** Once the state model has been created, it is no longer possible to access this wizard.

3. Define a *ModelState* model  
   - Open the modeler.  
   - Choose the *ModelState* template.    
   - Add a state created in 2.  
   - Right click on the state and choose *Fetch related* to insert all the relative states or select all the states to insert.  
   - The model presents the different states and their transitions, as well as the group(s) of rights authorized to make the transitions.   
   - Double click on a state opens the state form.  Double click on a transition open the transition form.
