GDPR guidelines
===============

Introduction
------------

Out of the box, the Simplicité platform **software** (referred as "the platform" in the rest of this document) does not manage any private data.

The only out of the box business object which has some potentially private data fields is the `User` business object level (see below), but out of the box the platform is only configured with anonymous technical users.

The platform is designed to process configured data which may include private information. Compliance with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation ">GDPR</abbr> (<abbr title="Règlement Général sur la Protection des Données">RGPD</abbr> in French) regarding any private data managed within Simplicité is the responsibility of the data controller. The following guidelines provide assistance for GDPR compliance.

> **Note**: all data configured in the platform is physically stored in the configured database(s).
> These databases are **external software components** from the point of view of the the platform.
> In other words the platform itself does not store any data.

Business data
-------------

When configuring business data (business objects and associated business fields), it is important to track and document whether the data is private. This can be done by explicitly indicating the privacy status in the description of the business object, business process, field or other relevant components.

Another approach is to extend the configuration of the system objects (e.g. the `Field` business object) to add some
structured information to classify the type of managed data (e.g. mark each field as `Personal`, `Private` or `Intimate`).
Once the configuration extension and classification data are implemented on fields, exports and reports can be generated based on this information.

> **Edit**: As of platform version **4.0 release 21** such a basic classification has been added to the `Field` object.
> The field classification indicates whether a field contains:
>
> - _Personal_ data (e.g. name, date of birth, ...),
> - _Confidential_ data (e.g. bank account number, password, ...)
> - _Intimate_ data (e.g. political preferences, ...)
>
> The `User` fields indicated below have been classified as an example.
>
> This basic classification can be extended as needed since this field is not used in the platform's core engine.

Users
-----

### User data

The `User` business object has several fields that can be considered as private data:

- login (field `usr_login`) - **required**
- firstname (field `usr_first_name`) - optional
- lastname (field `usr_last_name`) - optional
- picture (field `usr_image_id`) - optional
- email (field `usr_email`) - optional
- work phone number (field `usr_work_num`) - optional
- mobile/cellular phone number (field `usr_cell_num`) - optional
- home phone number (field `usr_home_num`) - optional
- address (fields `usr_address1`, `usr_address2`, `usr_zipcode`, `usr_city`, `usr_state` nd `usr_country`) - optional

> **Note**: out of the box the platform is only configured with 2 anonymous technical users (`designer` and `public`)
> the other users are business data as any other business data.

### Business data user-timestamping

Timestamped business objects have two technical fields (`created by` and `updated by`) which holds
the login of the user who has created/updated the considered record.

It is possible to implement specific business logic to erase/anonymize this timestamping data if required.

Social posts
------------

The social posts (globals or associated to business object records) are linked to the `User` business object
by the `pstUserId` reference field.

Social posts can be globally inhibited or at a business object per business object level.

It is possible to implement specific business logic to erase/anonymize this social post data if required.

Logging
-------

### Database logs

The platform's logging mechanisms are configured by default to use the login as string identifier
of the user who is attached to the log entry.

In the log business object `AppLogger` records there is a text field that holds the login `log_user`.

#### Technical logs

In the technical logs the login is present as plain text on each line. Ex (in this example the login is `designer`)

```plaintext
2018-08-28 15:35:00,479 INFO [com.simplicite.util.CronJob] SIMPLICITE|https://myapp.mysdomain.com||ICORECM005|designer|com.simplicite.util.CronJob|run||Job processed
```

It is possible to configure the default `log4j2.xml` file to change this behavior.
