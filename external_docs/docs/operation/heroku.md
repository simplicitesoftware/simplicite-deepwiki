Simplicité on Heroku&reg;
================================

Simplicité instances can easily be deployed on the Heroku&reg; PaaS.

Please refer to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/simplicitesoftware/heroku-template) for details.

> **Warning**: this repository may be **outdated** and incomplete.
> Docker-based deployments (see [this document](/docs/operation/docker)) are to be preferred over deployement on a proprietary PaaS.
> Our support capabilities on this PaaS is thus very limited so before choosing this option make sure you have required up-to-date expertise.
